# Budgeter 

* http://github.com/pellegrino/budgeter 

## DESCRIPTION:
Bucketer is a rails 3.2 web application for managing the finances a very
busy young couple, me (@pellegrino) and my lovely wife. Its main idea
is to quickly track everyday expenses, and being depolyed as easily as
possible (read: heroku friendly). 

## PROJECT GOALS: 

###  Track multiple accounts 
Me and my wife, together, have quite a few accounts. It should be easy
to track our overall taking that in consideration 

### Internationalization 
I poorly speak english, but my wife doesn't at all. It should be
usable to non-english speakers. 

### Friendly 
It should be grandma usable - mine probably won't use it, but maybe yours will
end up doing, so better have it in place. 

### Have multiple users
Every member of the family should be force... encouraged to track
their expenses at Budgeter, so each one should have it own account.
